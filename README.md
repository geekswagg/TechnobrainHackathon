## Q1 - Explanation:
Reading Input: Both programs start by reading a list of integers from the console, where the user inputs numbers separated by spaces.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicates are removed by converting the list to a set (which inherently removes duplicates).
Sorting: The list is then sorted in descending order.
Printing: Finally, the sorted list is printed to the console.
